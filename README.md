This is a base react app mainly to integrate different chart features.

Please clone the repo and follow the steps below,

1. npm install
2. npm start

I could not contribute much to the development as I had to meet my work deadline last week. I am sharing my GitHub repo now that has the code where I have started working on the React App to integrate chart capabilities.

My approach further:
1. Currently, data samples have been used in the front end (React) to play around with different chart integrations
2. I will design a code in python to setup neo4j graph database, find connections and parse data to the front end for the effective charting
3. Will setup Mongodb to explore dashboard visualizations since its built-in workload isolation eliminates impact of analytics queries on our operational application

If you could provide me some time by next week so that I can enhance this development further and scale up to your needs if required.
